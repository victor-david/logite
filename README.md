# Logite
Logite is a .Net Core WPF application to import and present information obtained
from nginx log files. If you have multiple domains on your server, you can
configure **Logite** to display the log files from each domain separately.

Using **Logite**, you can download log files from the remote server and import 
the files into a local database. Once imported, you can view the log files in different ways.
